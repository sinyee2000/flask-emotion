# flask-emotion

Web based game using Python and Flask along with some HTML and JavaScript running on Microsoft Azure. 
This game selects an emotion, and you have to try your best to show that emotion on your face. 
Once you have your best emotion face on, you take a picture with your camera and the web game will check to see what emotion you are showing using the Azure Face API. 
If it is the same as the one you were asked to show, you win.
